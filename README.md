# 🏝️ Tourist Attractions Recommendations in Jakarta

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple Machine Learning project developed as part of a postgraduate (Master's) assignment. The project provides recommendations for tourist attractions in Jakarta using a **content-based filtering approach**. It employs **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)** and **cosine similarity** to find the most relevant tourist destinations based on user preferences.

- **TF-IDF**: A technique to evaluate how important a word is in a document relative to a collection of documents.
- **Cosine Similarity**: A metric to measure the similarity between two vectors (in this case, the TF-IDF vectors of tourist destinations).

The project is built using **Flask** for the backend and **Tailwind CSS** for the frontend, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive web interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Recommend top tourist attractions in Jakarta based on user preferences.
- Uses **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** for recommendation.
- Flask-based API to serve recommendations.
- User-friendly web interface with **Tailwind CSS**.
